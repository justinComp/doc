# Simulation Tutorial For Lampe/Letteri/Taylor Computational Group  

## WELCOME!

Welcome to the Computational group! You join this project mainly because you like biomaterials, coding or just curious about MD.

Before you start, I want you to download: 

For people on Mac/Windows, everything should be the same!

Download VMD [Visual Molecular Dynamics](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/vmd-1.9.3/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1740806505460574&usg=AOvVaw3kcYOKcLUVKk_HkS8Yabzt). 

    VMD is mainly used to create our peptide systems using TCL Scripts

Download VSCode [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). 

    VSCode is mainly used as a text editor for PDB, PSF, TXT files and IDE for many of the programming languages including Python, TCL, and jupyter notebook
    If you need help with VSCode and how to work around it just let me (Justin) know 

Download Globus [Globus](https://www.globus.org/)

    This will allow you to transfer files from your local computer and Rivanna

Download Avogadro [Avogadro](https://two.avogadro.cc/index.html)
    
    Like chem draw, makes our molecules 

Go to CHARMM.GUI [CHARMM.GUI](https://charmm-gui.org/) and ask for an account.
    
    Make our psf files.
